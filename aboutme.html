<h1> HANI AHMED </h1>
<p> My name is Hani Ahmed. I was born in somalia and I flew to America in 2005 when I was five-years old with my family. I am a middle child so I was and still am a mediator when it comes to family matters. I moved to seattle in 2010 and I fell in love the rainy days and cold weather. I am currently attending Rainier Beach High school and I am part of the IB program.</p>  .</p>
