<h1> HANI AHMED </h1>
<p> My name is Hani Ahmed. I was born in somalia and I flew to America in 2005 when I was five-years old with my family. I am a middle child so I was and still am a mediator when it comes to family matters. I moved to seattle in 2010 and I fell in love the rainy days and cold weather. I am currently attending Rainier Beach High school and I am part of the IB program.</p>  .</p>

I thought robotics was a bad thing because although it connected people it also disconnnected them from the real world. these new technologies like the self driving car would just enable people to do what they want without facing consequences like with drunk driviing. I'm excited to actually make a robot of my own.
